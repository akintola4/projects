          where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a street after him. Also in that year, he became
          a
          member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

          contributions to the
          'green revolution' that was having such an impact on food production particularly in Asia and in Latin
          America."[64]
        </li>

          in Bonner Springs,
          Kansas. Also that year, he was recognized for sustained service to humanity through outstanding contributions
          in
          plant breeding from the Governors Conference on Agriculture Innovations in Little Rock, Arkansas. Also in
          1984,
          he received the Henry G. Bennet Distinguished Service Award at commencement ceremonies at Oklahoma State
          University. He recently received the Charles A. Black Award for his contributions to public policy and the
          public understanding of science.

        </li>
        <li>
      </ul>
      <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering
        intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

        -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</p>
